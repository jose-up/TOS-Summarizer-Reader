# Terms of Service Summarizer
With every product comes a very length Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that details everything that you agree to by using the product. While it’s necessary to have all of this information for legal reasons, it also creates an issue where people agree to something they’re not entirely ok with. To solve this, we will have a summarizer that lists out the key points of the Terms of Service model for each important section provided.

This project is a web app that reads, analyzes, and summarizes online Terms of Service and Privacy Policies using an AI model (Google studio API or similar). The tool generates a 3-sentence TL;DR and assigns a basic risk score, helping users quickly identify red flags before accepting agreements they would otherwise ignore.
