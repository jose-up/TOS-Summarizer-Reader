# The Document Privacy Analyzer!
This code is avaialbe for users to understand and modify. There may be some differences between the official website ([LINK WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE]) and the official GitHub page. 

## Associated with the BinaryHeart organization
This project started when I bought a Nintendo Switch 2 back on launch day and saw how Nintendo decided that users can't modify hardware for supposed "privacy concerns." This means that in a user were to find a back door where they modified the system and Nintendo ends up becoming suspicious of this device, they could just shut it off, causing you to lose your hard earned $450. However, they didn't publicly state this, as well as the many ways they made third-party hardware unusable in order to get more money from the consumer for their more expensive propreitary hardware.

There's no realisitc safety concern that they're protecting people from. It's just another way to crack down on user access. It's how these companies will exploit people. When it comes to devices with intricate software, companies will find ways to do this as well. With this web app, my goal is to allow the user to be aware, which will let consumers know exactly what they're getting into without having to read 30 page documents and analyze intricate legal jargon.
